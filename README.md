## Overview

Craft Env Sync is a plugin that makes it possible to sync your database and volume assets across numerous environments from the comfort of the Craft Control Panel. This makes it much easier to move your site from local development to staging and onto production.

![Craft Env Sync Overview](resources/img/overview.png)

This plugin uses AWS S3 (more providers to come soon) as the "single source of truth" for all site DB/volume asset backups. It provides an easy-to-configure settings page as well as an interface in Craft's "utilties" section to:

- Back up DB/volume assets locally
- Push backups to S3
- Pull backups from S3
- Restore backups

This plugin is inspired by ![Andrew Welsch's `craft-scripts` library](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts) who also [has a great blog post on syncing you DB and assets in Craft](https://nystudio107.com/blog/database-asset-syncing-between-environments-in-craft-cms).

## Configuration

Configuration is done through the dedicated "Sync" settings panel. The details entered here correspond to your AWS S3 account and bucket that you want to use for backups. It's recommended to set up a new IAM user that has programmatic access (meaning via a acces/secret key) to a private S3 bucket.

Once you have set this bucket up, you can either enter your AWS S3 details directly into the setting page, or you can use environment variables via your `.env` file (this is the recommended approach as seen in the screenshot above). This latter approach is more portable and secure as it prevents any private access/secret key values being included in files that you might commit to Github. Furthermore is means these variables can be reused in other plugins etc.

Here is an example portion of a  `.env` file:

```sh
...

AWS_ACCESS_KEY = 
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 
AWS_REGION = "us-west-2"
AWS_BUCKET_NAME = "feral-backups"
AWS_BUCKET_PREFIX = "craft-backups/my-site"
```

## Usage

### Control Panel

![Craft Env Sync Utilities Screenshot](resources/img/utilities-screenshot.png)

Once you have entered your settings variables you should be able to use the "sync" tab on the "utilities" section of the control panel.

There are two broad sections: one for the database and one for volume assets. Each section has four options to create a local backup, push that local backup to S3, pull all remote backups _from_ S3 and finally to restore a particular backup.

### Command Line

There are also console commands available for creating, pushing and pulling backups:

```sh
- env-sync/database                         Sync database backups
    env-sync/database/create-backup         Create a local database backup
    env-sync/database/pull                  Pull remote database backups from cloud
    env-sync/database/push                  Push local database backups to cloud

- env-sync/volumes                          Sync volumes backup
    env-sync/volumes/create-backup          Create a local volumes backup
    env-sync/volumes/pull                   Pull remote volume backups from cloud
    env-sync/volumes/push                   Push local volume backups to cloud
```

For example:

```sh
./craft env-sync/database/create-backup
```

These commands can be used alongside cron or your deployment scripts to automatically/periodically create backups.

## Functionality

All local backups are stored in the existing `storage/backups` folder that Craft uses for its own database backup script.

For database backups and restorations we use the existing Craft scripts - they are just included in our dashboard as an easier consolodated interface.

For volume assets backups, we simply create a versioned zip file containing the handles of all volume assets currently saved in the system. Bear in mind if you have a large number of assets this process may take some time and take up a significant amount of storage.

## Troubleshooting

If you are getting errors when you try to pull/push databases or assets, the first thing to check is the Craft logs at `storage/logs/web.log`. All errors should be logged here. The most likely issue is with your credentials, so double check that those are OK.
